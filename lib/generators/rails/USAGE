Description:
    Generates the html.erb views (and only those) of the scaffold generator for a given model.
    Pass the same arguments as you would to the scaffold generator, i.e. pass the name of 
    the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first argument,
    and then a list of attribute pairs ('fieldname:type').

    The following files are generated:
        - index.html.erb
        - show.html.erb
        - new.html.erb
        - edit.html.erb
        - _form.html.erb
        - _<model>.html.erb (partial)

Example:
    'bin/rails generate view post'
    'bin/rails generate view post title:string body:text published:boolean'
    'bin/rails generate view purchase amount:decimal tracking_id:integer:uniq'
    'bin/rails generate view user email:uniq password:digest'
