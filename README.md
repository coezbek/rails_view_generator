# RailsViewGenerator

This gem adds a Rails generator that creates just the view file which would normally generated by a `rails generate scaffold` command.

## Installation & Usage

```
bundle add rails_view_generator, group: :development

bundle install

rails generate view ModelName field_name:field_type field_name2:field_type2 ...
```

This generator utilizes the same look-up for the `.html.erb.tt` files as the original [scaffold generator](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/railties/lib/rails/generators/erb/scaffold/scaffold_generator.rb), which can be found in the [`rails/generators/erb/scaffold/templates`](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/railties/lib/rails/generators/erb/scaffold/templates).

You can customize these views by copying them to `lib/templates/erb/scaffold` and modifying them as needed.
